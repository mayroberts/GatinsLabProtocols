## 0. Prepare DNA

Removal of EDTA from DNA samples prior to fragmentation is recommended to ensure consistent
results. This may be achieved by means of a 3X bead based cleanup with KAPA cleanup beads. Please refer to the relevant Technical Data Sheet (KR1705 or KR1245) for a detailed DNA cleanup protocol. 

For optimal fragmentation results, **elute DNA in Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 - 8.5)** after the cleanup.

## 1. Fragmentation

- [ ] 1.1 Dilute 250 ng of dsDNA in Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 - 8.5) to reach a total volume of 11.7 µL (1/3 rx)
    - only do this if samples do not contain EDTA. Otherwise see original protocol for instructions to clean DNA or use Conditioning Solution. 

- [ ] 1.2 Mix by gentle vortexing or pipetting up and down
- [ ] 1.3 Assemble the fragmentation reaction on ice by adding the following components in order:

| Component            | Volume  | 1/3 Volume|
|:---------------------|:--------|:----------|
|250ng DNA             | 35 µL   | 11.7 µL   |
|KAPA Frag Bufer(10X)* | 5 µL    | 1.6µL     |
| KAPA Frag Enzyme*    | 10 µL   | 3.4 µL    |
|----------------------|---------|-----------|
|**Total Volume**      |**50 µL**|**16.7 µL**|
***OPTIONAL**: The KAPA Frag Buffer and Enzyme may be pre-mixed and kept on ice prior to reaction setup, and dispensed as a single solution*.

- [ ] 1.4 Vortex gently and spin down briefly. Return the plate/tue to ice and proceed immediately to the next step.
- [ ] 1.5 Incubate in a thermocycler, pre-cooled to 4°C and programmed as outlined below. A heated lid is not required for this step. If used, set the temperature of the heated lid to ≤50°C.

| Step | Temp | Time |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Pre-cool block  |  4°C  | N/A  |
|Fragmentation| 37°C| 7:45* |
|HOLD| 4°C| ∞ |
Fragmentation time was previously optimized for 500bp fragments starting from the optimization table below

| Mode Fragment Length | Incubation time at 37°C | Optimization range |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 600 bp  |  5 min  | 3- 10 min |
|350 bp| 10 min| 5- 20 min|
|200 bp| 20 min| 10- 25 min|
|150 bp| 30 min| 20- 40 min|

- [ ] **PREP**: get the End Repair & A-Tailing Buffer out of the freezer to begin melting for next step.

- [ ] 1.6 Transfer reactions to ice, and proceed immediately to End Repair and A-tailing (step 2).

## 2. End Repair and A-tailing

- [ ] 2.2 Vortex gently and spin down briefly. Return the reaction plate/tube(s) to ice. Proceed immediately to the next step.
    
- [ ] 2.3 Incubate in a thermocycler programmed as outlined below. A heated lid is required for this step. If possible, set the temperature of the heated lid to ~85°C (instead of the usual 105°C).

| Step | Temp | Time |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| End repair and A-tailing |  65°C  | 30 min  |
|HOLD| 4°C| ∞ |

## 5. Library Amplification

The KAPA Library Amplification Primer Mix (10X) is designed to eliminate or delay primer depletion during library amplification reactions performed with KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. The primer mix is suitable for the amplification of all Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flow cell sequences. Primers are supplied at a 10X concentration of 20 μM each, and have been formulated as described below. User-supplied primer mixes may be used in combination with incomplete or custom adapters. Please contact Technical Support at sequencing.roche.com/support for guidelines on the formulation of user-supplied library amplification primers.

• To achieve the highest amplification efficiency and avoid primer depletion, it is critical to use an optimal concentration of high-quality primers. Primers should be used at a final concentration of 0.5 – 4 μM each. For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.

• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3'-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles. To achieve the latter, store primers at 2°C to 8°C for short-term use, or as single-use aliquots at -15°C to -25°C.

- [ ] 5.1 Assemble each library amplification reaction as follows:

| Component | Volume | 1/3 Volume|Notes|
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----|
|KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X)  | 25 µL  | 8.3 µL   ||
| Library Amplification Primer Mix (10X)* | 5 µL | 1.7 µL | if using custon Primers i5/i7 they should be at [20µM]|
| Adapter-ligated library | 20 µL | 6.7 µL ||
|--------------------|------|------|------|
|**Total Volume**|**50 µL**| **16.7 µL**||

- [ ] 5.2 Mix thoroughly and centrifuge briefly.
- [ ] 5.3 Amplify using the following cycling protocol:

| Step | Temp | Time |Cycles|
|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
|Initial Denaturation  |  98°C  | 45 sec |1|
|Denaturation| 98°C| 15 sec ||
|Annealing| 60°C| 30 sec |8X|
|Extension| 72°C| 30 sec ||
