# Protocol for making 20x Low TE Buffer
[Edit this page](https://github.com/remygatins/GatinsLab/edit/main/low_te_buffer.qmd)

## Materials
-[x] Tris base
-[x] EDTA (Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic Acid, Disodium Salt Dihydrate)
-[x] HCL
-[X] DI water
-[x] stir bar

## Equipment
-[x] magnetic stir plate
-[x] pH meter


## Protocol
1.
-Measure out 800 ml deionized water into a graduated cylinder.
-Tranfer to large (1000 ml) erlenmeyer flask

2. 
-Add 24.22g Tris Base
-Add 0.584g EDTA

3. 
-Add magnetic stir bar
-Mix for 5 mins at 300 rpm on magnetic stir plate

4.
-Set up magnetic stir plate and pH meter in fume hood
-calibrate pH meter if it hasn't been calibrated recently
  -Use 2-3 pH standards, find directions for calibration elsewhere, might be a good thing to add
  -**Keep pH meter in a liquid always! Do not let probe dry out!**

5. 
-Keep mixture mixing on magnetic stir plate at 300rpm
-Put the pH meter's probe into mixture
-Slowly add quantities of HCl, checking pH as you go, until pH is 8.0
  -As pH lowers, more HCl will be required to continue to lower it since pH is a log scale
  -Last time it took **(XXX)** amount of HCl

6. 
-Bring volume to 1L with DI water

7.
-Tranfer mixture into a long-term autoclave-safe storage container

8.
-Autoclave for 50 min with cap tightened to a single turn
-Store
