# Protocol for making low TE buffer


**20x TE (dry reagents, Tris Base):**
1. measure out 800 ml deionized water in a graduated cylinder
2. combine DI water with 24.22g Tris Base and 0.584g EDTA in 1000 ml erlenmeyer flask
4. add magnetic stir bar
5. mix for 5 mins at 300 rpm with no heat
6. adjust pH to 8 in fume hood using HCl (adding small quantaties at a time)
7. bring volume to 1 L with DI water
8. transfer mixture long term storage container
9. autoclave
