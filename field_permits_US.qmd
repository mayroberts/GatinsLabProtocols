# Recreational Fishing Licenses
Recreational fishing (via pole or spear) is quite simple in Florida. [Here] (https://myfwc.com/license/recreational/saltwater-fishing/) is the page for Recreational Saltwater Licenses & Permits and [here] (https://myfwc.com/fishing/saltwater/recreational/spearing/) is the page with specific information regarding spearing.

# Special Activity Licenses
A **[Special Activity License (SAL)]** (https://myfwc.com/license/saltwater/special-activity-licenses/) is required if collection plans exceed marine fisheries regulations. In order to collect *Holacanthus*, a SAL is required because families of ornamental reef fish such as angelfish are on the prohibited species harvest list (see Spearing page for details).

  There are a few different types of SALs, but we will be submitting a [Scientific Research SAL] (https://myfwc.com/media/1193/sal-scientificresearch.pdf).
