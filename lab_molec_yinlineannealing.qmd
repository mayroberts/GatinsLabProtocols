# Annealing Y-in line adapters for use in Illumina WGS (PAGE IN PROGRESS)
## Custom adapters from Dr. Katie Lotterhos

[Edit this page](https://github.com/remygatins/GatinsLabProtocols/edit/main/lab_molec_yinlineannealing.qmd)

To create adapter P1, combine each oligo 1a with its complementary oligo 1b in a 1:1 ratio in working strength annealing buffer (final buffer concentration 1X) for a total annealed adapter concentration of 40 µM. 

## Stock Adapter Oligos
The stock oligos are in the -80 in the Lotterhos Lab. These are kept at concentrations of 500 µM.
