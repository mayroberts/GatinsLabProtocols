## Florida

As we plan to collect *Holacanthus* in Florida in July 2024, I have been keeping track of correspondence with dive shops and field stations to track costs and availability.

# Site 1: Fort Pierce, FL

**Smithsonian Marine Station**

  - **Contact(s):** **Dr. Valerie Paul** (Head Scientist, *paul@si.edu*), **Scott Jones** (Station Manager, *JonesMS@si.edu*), **Zach Foltz** (DSO, *FoltzZ@si.edu*)

First, I inquired with Zach Foltz about *Holacanthus* in the area as I read online that he has a strong interest in reef fish monitoring:

*February 21, 2024*

>Hello,
>
>I am a first-year PhD student at Northeastern University advised by Dr. Remy Gatins. For my research, I am very interested in exploring genomic divergence in Holacanthus angelfish species in the Tropical Western Atlantic. Remy and I are currently discussing locations for sample collection and we are curious about collaboration opportunities at the Smithsonian Marine Station in Fort Pierce. That being said, we are wondering how often if at all you see Holacanthus ciliaris and/or Holacanthus bermudensis around the station and if there are any sites you may recommend for collection.

>Thank you in advance. Looking forward to hearing from you!
>Cheers,
>Annabel

>Good Afternoon Annabel,
>We do see some of each species in our area. We see more of the H. bermudensis locally and more of the H. ciliaris down south (West Palm and south). They are mostly found on the nearshore bottom habitat in 10' - 30' of water. These are easily accessible in the summer when the water is typically clear and calm. There are some in the inshore waters as well but they are not quite as abundant.

>I hope that helps.

>Kind Regards,
>Zach

Following up this conversation, I emailed Dr. Valerie Paul about station availability:

*February 27, 2024*

>Hi Dr. Paul,
>
>I am reaching out to inquire about space availability at the Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce this summer. My advisor Dr. Remy Gatins (CC’d here) and I are hoping to conduct fieldwork in the beginning of July which would require lodging as well as boat usage. Any details you can share with us regarding availability around this time as well as typical procedures for boat operation and shared equipment will be extremely helpful.

>Thank you in advance!
>Cheers,
>Annabel

*February 27, 2024*

>Hello Annabel, I’ve copied our station manager Scott Jones who can help you with prices and arrangements. It is not clear from the message below what dates you plan to be in Ft. Pierce, how many boat trips you might need and what your research plans are in Ft. Pierce. We may need a few more details. Many thanks, Valerie

*February 28, 2024*

>Hi Valerie and Scott,
>
>Thank you for getting back to me so quickly! Apologies for the lack of detail — we are still trying to nail things down but station availability will likely help us get there. 
>
>We are interested in a 3-day stay during the first week of July. Our plan is to collect Holacanthus angelfish for my research focused on understanding the origins of divergence between the two species in the Tropical Western Atlantic: Holacanthus ciliaris and Holacanthus bermudensis. We heard from Zach Foltz that at least bermudensis is found commonly in the area. Ideally we will collect 10-15 individuals (of each species if possible) via scuba by spearing, so we’re interested in making 2-3 boat trips to nearshore sites as Zach recommended.

>Please let me know if more details are needed! I appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you.

>Thank you,
>Annabel

*February 28, 2024*

>Thanks for this information. Of course, we would need your IACUC approvals to support this work. You should also reach out to FWC about whether a Special Activity License is needed or you can do the work on a fishing license. 
>Thanks, Valerie

*February 29, 2024*

>Hi everyone-
> 
>Sorry for joining the conversation late!
> 
>We currently have space in the Tyson House during the first week of July, depending on how many people are in your group- we can host 2-3 people.
>
>I've attached here a list of prices for lodging and boat trips. As soon as you know the exact dates, and numbers of people, please let me know so I can get you on the calendar. Please let me know if I can be of any assistance with the permitting.

>Scott

# Site 2: Jupiter, FL

  - **Contact(s):** Jupiter Dive Center
    - Phone: 561-745-7807

When I called the dive shop, they gave me the following tips:

- Inshore spots will be good for finding queens and blues
- Go at high tide
- **Recommended sites:
  - Blue Heron Bridge
  - Kados Bridge
  - Dubois Park (likely to find along the rocks)**

- [ ] *TO DO: Call these sites to find out about snorkeling versus scuba and spearing regulations within parks*

# Site 3: Miami, FL
# Site 4: Tavernier, FL (Key Largo)

  - **Contact(s):** Conch Republic Divers
    - Phone: 305-852-1655
    - Spoke to Christian - he used to collect queens for scientific collections so he said he has great site suggestions for us.

  - Fees: To be taken privately on their smaller boat set up for spearing, it would be ~$900 for a half day. *Note: They only allow spearing via scuba, no snorkeling*

- [ ] *TO DO: Call back with specific dates in mind and ask about site specifics and get a solid quote for boat rental (ex. if we go with other people it will likely be less expensive)

# Site 5: Layton, FL (Long Key)

  - **Contact(s):** Keys Marine Laboratory
    - Phone: 305-664-9101
    - As of my phone call on March 4, 2024 they had availability for 2 visitors for all of July open. When ready to reserve, fill out the [KML Preliminary Reservation Request form](https://www.fio.usf.edu/forms/kml-preliminary-reservation-request/). 

  - Fees: There is a price calculator on the [KML Rates, Forms, and Information](https://www.fio.usf.edu/keys-marine-lab/kml-booking-information/forms-and-information/) page.
